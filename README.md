 ### Pitch

The value of this project is in the way we are able to conceptualize the relationships between seemingly disparate data in our world.

### Problem

Art (in this case, music), takes its cues from the world around it. When we see certain changes in the political and economic climate of society, we tend to see shifts in the cultural artifacts that come out of that time. It can be difficult to see the structure of the relationship between art and life in the abstract.

### Solution

This app will take data from popular culture and analyze it to pull out condensed ideas about the world, then track those ideas alongside historical markers relating to politics, economics, and social climate. The idea in broad terms is that the app will accomplish this in a mainly visual medium, and do so interactively.

### Target Audience

Anyone who is curious about how things are connected in our social world.

### Integrations

 * Which APIs will you use? * Which APIs will you use?
  * Watson will do my data analysis. I see that as the main API I will use. Other than an API, I will be bringing in datasets in CSV format from Kaggel. Those CSVs will be lyrical content from top 40 songs in one table, political data in another, and economic data in a third. There is a good chance I will add to that list with more datasets, but that is the baseline I'm aiming to start with.
 * Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?
  * At this point I don't see a need for OAuth. I don't think I will be building something anyone would log into.
